# 🛡️ Python Keylogger with GUI

This project is a **Keylogger tool built using Python** with a user-friendly **GUI interface** developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
It is created **strictly for educational and ethical purposes**, demonstrating how keystrokes can be captured and managed using Python's powerful libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time keystroke logging
- GUI built with `Tkinter`
- Start, Stop, and Clear controls
- Option to save logs to a `.txt` file
- Transparent operation — no hidden background logging

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- `pynput` for keyboard event listening
- `tkinter` for GUI interface
- `datetime` and `os` for file handling

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Start the GUI**  
   Launch the Python script to open the keylogger interface.

2. **Click "Start Logging"**  
   Begins capturing all keystrokes in real time and displays them in the GUI.

3. **Click "Stop Logging"**  
   Stops the listener and disables further recording.

4. **Click "Save Log"**  
   Saves the logged keystrokes to a text file for reference.

5. **Click "Clear"**  
   Clears the current log from the display.
